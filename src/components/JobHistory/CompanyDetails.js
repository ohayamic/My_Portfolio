          I worked as a software consultant for five years with Trustcare
          Solutions Nigeria Limited. My most important tasks include ensuring
          that clients' needs are properly communicated to our technical team. I
          also ensure the newly implemented features meet our customers' needs
          through testing and troubleshooting. Thirdly, I use my skills as an
          Oracle certified associate to build databases to house clients data
          properly. I am also part of the team that deployed and train users to
          how to use the software in our clients' establishment. Finally I am
          part of the team that provide 24/7 support for the software.
